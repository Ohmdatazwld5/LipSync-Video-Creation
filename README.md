# LipSync-AI-Model
# Objective
The goal of this project is to showcase expertise in building an advanced AI model for lip-syncing, which involves the synchronization of an audio file with a video file. The primary objective is to ensure that the AI model accurately matches the lip movements of characters in a given video with the corresponding audio, creating a seamless and natural visual and auditory experience for the viewer

# Task Description
Task is to develop and demostrate an AI model that excels in the art of lip-syncing. You will need to leverage cutting-edge technologies and tools, such as Pre-trained model Wav2Lip, to achieve precise synchronization of lip movements with spoken words or sounds in a video.

# Resources
- Video File: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMuuEv37s0o
- Audio File: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jhUOAeGw8lPjNf7Q1cIcBOvzE3CJ3gVz/view

# Output
The expected outcome of the lip-syncing task is the generation of a video file. In this video, lip movements of the characters in the original video will be meticulously synchronized with the corresponding audio file.

# Additional Information
The Wav2Lip model can be trained on a larger dataset to improve its lip-syncing quality. The LRS2 dataset is commonly used for training the Wav2Lip nmodel. Its a largest publically available datasets for lip reading sentences in-the-wild. It consists of thousands of spoken sentences from BBC television, wih each sentence being up to 100 characters in length.
